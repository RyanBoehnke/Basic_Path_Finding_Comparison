# Basic_Path_Finding_Comparison
A comparison of Dijkstra's Algorithm (DA), Greedy Best First Search (GBFS), and A* on a 256x256 pixel map. This represents an improvement over my basic A* project.

The percentage of the map given over to blockers can be changed, and the likelihood that it will be unpathable increases with the blocker percentage.

Outputs 7 images to the results file. The base map with blockers, the nodes visted by the agent, as well as the visited nodes and path for each algorithm.
